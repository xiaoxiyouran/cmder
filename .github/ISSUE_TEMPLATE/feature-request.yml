        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        Please make sure you read and follow the following instructions carefully before reporting bugs, and/or requesting new features.

        Make sure that you have:

        - Searched for existing issues (including the **closed** ones) for similar feature requests here:

          üóÉ https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=is:issue

        - If you are opening the feature request regarding any of the **upstream technologies** that are used by Cmder, please open the feature request at the corresponding upstream repos instead:
            - **[Clink](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink)**, the default shell in Cmder
            - **[ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu)**, the terminal emulator
            - **[Git/MinGW](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git)**, which also provide *NIX tools (such as `ls`, `mv`, `cp`, etc)
            - **[clink-completions](https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions)**, which provides autocompletion for clink

        - If you would like to ask for guides on how to integrate Cmder with your favorite IDE of choice, or how to perform a specific task with Cmder, make sure you visit our label section first.

          You may already have an answer under the Guides or Questions section.

          For a list of labels, visit **[üåê Labels](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/labels)**.

          (Be sure to also check ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù issues in the labels section!)

        - If you have a request to provide auto-complete support for a new tool, please post your request here instead:

          https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/issues

        Thank you for making the Cmder project even better! ‚ô•

        ### Some tips on how to write a better feature request
        - Make sure the description is worded well enough to be understood, and with as much context and examples as possible.
        - Use the *Preview* tab to see how your issue will actually look like, before sending it.
          ‚ö† If for some reason you can not see the text you just wrote, make sure you've read the instructions clearly
        - Please keep the ticket language to English only here.
          We can't process your issue if it's written in Russian or Chinese as we can't understand them.
