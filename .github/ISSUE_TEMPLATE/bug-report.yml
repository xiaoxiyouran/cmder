        Make sure that you have:

        - Read both the README.md and the Wiki:

          | üåê [Open Link](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md) | üåê [Open Link](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki) |

          (What you may be asking here could already be explained there!)

        - Searched for existing issues (including the **closed** ones) for similar problems here:

          üóÉ https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=is:issue

        - Please understand that Cmder uses ConEmu as the default underlying Terminal Emulator.

          If your issue is regarding the **Terminal Emulator**, please visit the ConEmu issues page:

          https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues?q=is:issue

          If there isn't an existing issue, you may open a new one there.

          (We don't resolve issues regarding ConEmu here, so, please make sure you open the issue in the correct place.)

          more info: https://conemu.github.io/en/ThirdPartyProblems.html

        - If you are having an issue with any of the **upstream technologies** that are used by Cmder, please make sure that the issue is reproducible _only_ when used in combination with Cmder.

          We may not directly address the issues related to the following tools:
              - **[Clink](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink)**, the default shell in Cmder
              - **[ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu)**, the terminal emulator
              - **[Git/MinGW](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git)**, which also provide *NIX tools (such as `ls`, `mv`, `cp`, etc)
              - **[clink-completions](https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions)**, which provides autocompletion for clink

          We'll try our best to help you -- but we recommend creating an issue specifically at each of the corresponding repositories for the best result.

          **üëâ Note:** Try to reproduce the bug you're reporting, on a stand-alone edition of each tool, without using Cmder.  If the bug applies when the mentioned tools are NOT used within Cmder, there's a good chance that you should open the bug at the corresponding repo instead.

        - Lastly, have a look at the official documentation for Cmder over our website, and our wiki.

          Read more about Cmder on ConEmu docs:
          https://conemu.github.io/en/cmder.html

        #### Prerequisites before submitting an issue
        - We do not support any versions older than the current release series, if you are using an older Cmder please update to the latest version first.
        - Verify that the issue is not already fixed and is reproducible in the **[latest official Cmder version](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases).**
        - Check the **[current issues list](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=is%3Aissue)** and perform a **search of the issue tracker (including closed ones)** to avoid posting a duplicate bug report.
        - Make sure this is not a support request or question, both of which are better suited for either the **[discussions section](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/discussions)**, or the **[questions section](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/new?template=question.yml)**.
        - Verify that the **[wiki](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki)** did not contain a suitable solution either.

        ### Some tips on how to write a good bug report with the required information.
        - Make sure the description is worded well enough to be understood, and with as much context and examples as possible.
        - Post a screenshot or the command that triggered the problem, if applicable.
        - Use the *Preview* tab to see how your issue will actually look like, before sending it.
          ‚ö† If for some reason you can not see the text you just wrote, make sure you've read the instructions clearly
        - Avoid using ambiguous phrases like: doesn't work, there's a problem, etc.
          Help us reproduce the issue by explaining what went wrong, and what did you expect to happen.
        - Please keep the ticket language to English only here.
          We can't process your issue if it's written in Russian or Chinese as we can't understand them.
        - You can find the version of Cmder.exe and ConEmu.exe binaries using Right Click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Details menu.
        - Put an `x` into all the boxes `[ ]` relevant to your issue (correct example: `[x]` -- not like this: `[ x]` or `[x ]`).
        - Any text that is between the comment tags will get ignored, e.g.: `<!-- this will NOT work -- >`
          You need to write your text either outside the tags, or the line below it.
        - ‚ö† Read the following page to avoid posting a bad issue: https://conemu.github.io/en/BadIssue.html

        Failure to follow these guidelines may result in your issue getting closed. So please follow it carefully!
